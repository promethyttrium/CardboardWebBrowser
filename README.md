# CardboardWebBrowser
Just experimental project to bring web browser into google cardboard

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.entireangle.zerohoon.cardboardwebbrowser

You can click things with the magnetic button.

I'm having some technical issues with this project.

1. Video is not working
2. Webgl is not working
3. Need to build all the web browser's UI component in opengl environment.
(address bar, scroll bar, backward and fowared button)

Is there anybody who know solve this problem?
